It was done for a personal website.

There are 3 apptemps:

The first attemp was done with PHP + Angular. Very wired, I just want to try PHP

The second attemp was done with Socket.IO with MEAN. I didn't know RESTful at that time, so socket is nice~

The third attemp was done with RESTful and MEAN. clean and elegent, which is in the final_attemp folder. But due to size, only partial codes are here.
